# Project 4 - Delphine Trahand  - Music classes scheduler
In my small city, we have a very good music school, but at the beginning of the year, when the time comes to create the class schedules, it is true chaos:
The music teachers have to set up the students’ schedule. Parents are summoned together, and together with the teacher sit in a room and set up the schedule according to everybody’s free time.

This website aims at helping the teacher manage her students' schedule at the beginning of the year:
* The teacher inputs the days and hours where she/he is free. From there, the student inputs the days and hours where he/she would like to take the music classes.
* I have added a grade function, where teachers can enter/modify/delete grades, and students can view their grades.
